## Body
Les paul shape??

## Bridge
- Floyd rose with EVH D-Tuna and Tremol-no system
- [Kahler tremolo](https://www.kahlerusa.com/flat-mount-tremolos-bridges) Seems
    like it has some merit over the floyd rose
- gibson style tune-o-matic

## electronics config

### Pickups
- Fishman Fluence
    - differences in Modern vs Classic
- maybe throw in a piezo bridge...
- perpedicular or angled?
    - maybe angled at the bridge, but might also want to keep it simple

### Controls
- 1 switch for voicing
    - push pull or toggle?
- 1 pickup selector
    - 5 way toggle (neck, neck and bridge inner, neck and bridge, neck outer, bridge)
- two volume knobs, two tone knobs
- killswitch (momentary button)
    - could probably just use the pickup selector
 
## Neck
- 25.5" scale
- 43mm or 44mm nut
- 24 frets probably
width? reall depends on bridge
scale
number of frets, 24?
